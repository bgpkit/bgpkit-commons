## Overview

BGPKIT-Commons is a library for common BGP-related data and functions.

It provides the following modules:
- `mrt_collectors`: public RouteViews and RIPE RIS MRT mrt_collectors information extracted from their official APIs
- `asinfo`: Autonomous System (AS) information and country lookup
- `countries`: country code to name and other information lookup
- `rpki`: RPKI validation data. Historical data from RIPE NCC and real-time data from Cloudflare
- `bogons`: IP prefix and ASN bogon lookup
- `as2rel`: AS-level relationship data, generated by BGPKIT

### Basic Usage

Add `bgpkit-commons` to your `Cargo.toml`'s `dependencies` section:
```toml
bgpkit-commons = "0.7"
```

`bgpkit-commons` is designed to load only the data you need. Here is an example of checking if an ASN is a bogon ASN:

```rust
use bgpkit_commons::BgpkitCommons;

let mut bgpkit = BgpkitCommons::new();
bgpkit.load_bogons().unwrap();
assert!(bgpkit.bogons_match("23456").unwrap());
```

The common steps include:
1. create a mutable `BgpkitCommons` instance
2. load the data you need by calling `bgpkit.load_xxx()` functions
3. use the data by calling the corresponding functions, named as `bgpkit.xxx_yyy()`

For detailed usages, please refer to the module documentation.

### Feature Flags

- `rustls` (default): use rustls instead of native-tls for the underlying HTTPS requests
- `native-tls`: use native-tls as the backend
